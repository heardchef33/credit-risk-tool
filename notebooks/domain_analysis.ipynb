    "# Understanding Creditworthiness\n",
    "\n",
    "Creditworthiness is a valuation performed by lenders to determine the possibility that a borrower may default on their debt obligations. It is assessed using several data points and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Core Characteristics of Creditworthiness\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Credit Score:** A numerical representation of creditworthiness (e.g., FICO).\n",
    "* **Payment History:** An individual's record of timely or late payments.\n",
    "* **Credit Utilization:** The ratio of used credit relative to the total credit limit.\n",
    "* **Length of Credit History:** The age of your oldest and newest accounts.\n",
    "* **Types of Credit:** The variety of accounts (credit cards, retail accounts, installments, mortgages).\n",
    "* **New Credit Inquiries:** The frequency of recent credit applications.\n",

    "## 2. Assessment Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 5Cs Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The 5Cs is a traditional system used by lenders to gauge the \"riskiness\" of a borrower.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Definition | Key Indicators |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Capacity** | Ability to generate income to cover debt + interest. | Income sources, employment stability, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. |\n",
    "| **Character** | Reputation, credibility, and trustworthiness. | Credit history, credit score, payment behavior. |\n",
    "| **Collateral** | Assets pledged as security in case of default. | Real estate, equipment, or inventory. |\n",
    "| **Conditions** | External factors affecting repayment ability. | Interest rates, loan purpose, market trends, loan terms. |\n",
    "| **Capital** | The borrower's overall net worth. | Savings, investments, and personal assets. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 5Ps Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The 5Ps model is often used in business or more detailed personal lending assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Personality:** Traits and character of the borrower.\n",
    "* *Indicators:* Education, professional experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Payment:** Current and historical payment habits.\n",
    "* **Purpose:** The specific reason for the loan.\n",
    "* *Indicators:* Loan amount, duration, and repayment plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prospect:** Future outlook and potential for repayment.\n",
    "* *Indicators:* Income stability/growth, business plan, market demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Protection:** Safeguards or guarantees provided in case of default.\n",
    "* *Indicators:* Collateral or insurance.\n",

    "## 3. Understanding FICO Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "FICO is the primary credit scoring system used in the United States. It quantifies credit risk into a single three-digit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of a FICO Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The score is calculated based on the following weightings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Payment History (35%):** Whether you pay on time.\n",
    "2. **Amounts Owed (30%):** Your total debt and utilization ratio.\n",
    "3. **Length of Credit History (15%):** How long you’ve been using credit.\n",
    "4. **Credit Mix (10%):** The variety of credit products you hold.\n",
    "5. **New Credit (10%):** Recent inquiries and newly opened accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above frameworks and understanding of the FICO score was used to gain understanding of the features and to remove unnecessary features that theoretically does not fit into the above frameworks."
